# Stanley Cup Tournament Website

Files in this repository are used to build a server-side web application to host a Stanley Cup tournament at Colorado School of Mines. The website is hosted on [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) for free. 

Screenshots of the website, shown below, demonstate the four main pages. First is the home page, which includes blogging capabilities. Blog posts can only be added by the tournament administrators which have direct access to the admin page via their own personal login. The second page shows the master bracket results. Tables for each series and the master bracket itself are autogenerated once for the scores for any game are updated on the server. The third page displays participants' standings. The table on this page can be sorted by name, pointer, or total possible points (TTP). In addition, a participant's personal bracket can be displayed by clicking on their row in the table. As with the master page, the table and brackets for the standings page are all autogenerated any time a game score is updated. The final image shows the submission page. This page is only open before the tournament officially starts. Administrators control when the form is open and closed through their admin portal. The submission form propogates teams forward in the bracket as their buttons are clicked. The selected teams are also highlighted in green as the user makes their selection. Logic is built in to ensure that if a user decides to change their selection for an earlier series, all subsequent series are automatically updated as well.

To see the site live, visit [https://www.csmbracket.pythonanywhere.com](https://csmbracket.pythonanywhere.com/bracket/). Please not that the site may not be hosted year round. The free pythonanywhere accounts require that the site be refreshed every three months to continue being hosted. Since the tournament is not a year round event, the site may not have been recently refreshed when you go to visit. The best time to check is just before, during, or after the Stanley Cup in any given year.
